      <h3>
        There's a Cat in a Bucket
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is a cat in this bucket. This cat is My cat he is very cute and curious. As a ragdoll cat he doesn't mind
        being picked up. He is my topic for the music program I am building for this program I am using both him
        specificly and other cats like Maxwell the cat in the player. The formating of the website is attempting to
        mirror a newspaper article and for a color scheme im using a white black and turqouise as I think this will
        create a clean look while still adding some color to the website. Under this section there is a video section
        these videos have been muted so they can automaticly be played. These are both examples of cat based music.
        These videos are a part of memes surrounding them but the origin of the music is slightly hard to figure out.
        I'll Probably figure something out though.

        Music Player Description
      </h3>
      <p id="No">
        This is a music player that plays music that is cat based. The music is very cool and is very nice to listen to.
        This music player is going to have an associated game with it. This game will take up the left two thirds of the
        screen. The music player itself will have three diffrent songs with it. These songs will be accessable from the
        bottom right of the program. The music program will also contain a image based around the song and some info
        like
        the title and the author of the music. Above both the info and image will be the controls for the music player.
        The music player will have a play/pause button, a stop button, a skip button, and a volume slider.
